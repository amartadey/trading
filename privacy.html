            as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone
            number. Trading Forex USA also collects anonymous demographic

          </p>
          <p>
            There is also information about your computer hardware and software
            that is automatically collected by Trading Forex USA. This
            information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain
            names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This
            information is used by Trading Forex USA for the operation of the

            Trading Forex USA encourages you to review the privacy statements of
            Web sites you choose to link to from Trading Forex USA so that you
            can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your

          <h4>Use of your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA collects and uses your personal information to
            operate the Trading Forex USA Web site and deliver the services you
            have requested. Additionally, to help the government fight the
            funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law
            requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record
            information that identifies each person who opens an account.
          </p>
          <p>
            What this means to you: When you open an account, we will ask for
            your name, address, date of birth and other information that will
            allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's
            license or other identifying documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA also uses your personally identifiable information
            to inform you of other products or services available from Trading

            services or of potential new services that may be offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to
            third parties. Trading Forex USA may, from time to time, contact you
            on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering
            that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique
            personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address,
            telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In
            addition, Trading Forex USA may share data with trusted partners to
            help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail,
            provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third
            parties are prohibited from using your personal information except
            to provide these services to Trading Forex USA, and they are
            required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

            Trading Forex USA keeps track of the Web sites and pages our
            customers visit within Trading Forex USA, in order to determine what

            to deliver customized content and advertising within Trading Forex
            USA to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested
            in a particular subject area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA Web sites will disclose your personal information,
            without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good
            faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the
            edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Trading
            Forex USA or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property
            of Trading Forex USA; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to

          <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            The Trading Forex USA Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize
            your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on
            your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
            programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
            assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
            that issued the cookie to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
            feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
            server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
            you personalize Trading Forex USA pages, or register with Trading
            Forex USA site or services, a cookie helps Trading Forex USA to
            recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This
            simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such
            as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return
            to the same Trading Forex USA Web site, the information you
            previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
            Trading Forex USA features that you customized.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
            browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
            decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
            interactive features of the Trading Forex USA services or Web sites
            you visit.
          </p>
          <h4>Security of your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA secures your personal information from
            unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Trading Forex USA secures
            the personally identifiable information you provide on computer
            servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
            unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information
            (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it
            is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
            Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
          </p>
          <h4>Changes to this Statement</h4>
          <p>

            to reflect company and customer feedback. Trading Forex USA
