          <h4>High-risk investment</h4>
          <p>
            Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and
            may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage
            can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade
            foreign exchange, you should carefully consider your investment
            objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility
            exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial
            investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot
            afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with
            foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent
            financial advisor if you have any doubts.
          </p>

          <h4>Rebate payments</h4>
          <p>
            Trading Forex USA diligently pays all clients according to either
            the currently listed rates or the agreed-upon rate. Rebates for
            products and services that allow refunds are paid after the
            expiration of the refund period. Any custom quotes/offers must be
            approved in writing. Certain situations can occur that would prevent
            payments from being made i.e. if a broker refuses to pay, or if an
            individual has provided incorrect payment information. The pending
            is shown for informational purposes only and may not be accurate.
            Trading Forex USA may be given all details of your trading activity
            by Brokers: i.e. (instrument, open, close, volumes, etc.) to be to
            properly compute your rebate. Trading Forex USA owners, operators,
            and affiliates shall have no liability or obligation under any
            circumstance to issue client payments for any reason, and all
            payments are issued at our sole discretion. If at any time Trading
            Forex USA becomes unable to collect funds from any broker(s) or
            contracted firms/entities then Trading Forex USA reserves the right
            not to pay clients. Trading Forex USA shall not be indebted to any
            client or other party for any reason regardless of whether Trading
            Forex USA has received compensation based on actions or agreements
            executed by the client. Trading Forex USA reserves the right to
            change or discontinue any rebates offer at any time with or without
            notice. Churning is frowned upon by most brokers. If your trading is
            identified as churning by the broker our commissions may be voided
            by the broker and this will also void any rebate you may expect to
            receive.
          </p>
          <h4>Fees incurred related to payments</h4>
          <p>
            Certain reasonable fees may be incurred by clients as a result of
            payments. Wire fees, PayPal, Neteller, Skrill, and other similar
            costs and the labor associated with these services may be charged to
            the client’s account and deducted from the payment amount.
          </p>
